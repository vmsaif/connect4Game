# Connect 4
This is a Java program that implements the classic Connect 4 game using an interface and Java GUI. The user can play against a computer opponent, whose logic was implemented by me. The objective of the game is to get four of your colored circles in a line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Notice the logic is written in such a way, the computer opponent will try to block the user from winning. However, to keep the game fun, it will ignore occasionally. 

# What I Have Learned
1. Implementing interfaces and abstract classes in Java
2. Designing and implementing the logic for a computer opponent
3. Working with Java GUI elements, such as buttons and labels
4. Testing and debugging code to ensure it is functioning correctly

## Running
1. Ensure that you have the latest version of Java installed on your computer.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run the command `javac *.java` to compile the Java files in the src directory to bin directory.
4. Run the command `java SIMULATE.java` to run the main program.

Follow the prompts in the GUI to play the game.
